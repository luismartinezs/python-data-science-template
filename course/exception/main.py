try, except, else, and finally
try: This block contains the code that might raise an exception.
except: This block contains the code that runs when an exception is raised in the try block.
else: If no exceptions are raised, the code in this block will be executed after the try block.
finally: This block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. Itâ€™s commonly used for cleanup actions (e.g., closing files).
