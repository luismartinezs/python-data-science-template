### Basic-Level Python Exercises

#### **Exercise 1: File I/O and Exception Handling**
Write a program that reads a text file line by line and prints each line to the console. If the file doesn't exist, catch the exception and print a custom error message. Additionally, write the number of lines to a new file called `summary.txt`.

#### **Exercise 2: Functions and List Comprehensions**
Create a function `filter_numbers` that takes a list of integers and a threshold value. The function should return a new list of numbers from the original list that are greater than the threshold. Use list comprehensions inside the function.

#### **Exercise 3: Classes and Inheritance**
Define a class `Vehicle` with attributes like `brand` and `speed`. Include a method to display these details. Then create a subclass `Car` that inherits from `Vehicle` and adds an additional attribute `num_doors`. Override the method to also display the number of doors. Create instances of both classes and display their details.
