### **Additional Tips:**

- **Plan Before Coding:** Before you start coding, take some time to plan your approach. Outline the steps your program needs to take and consider how you'll implement key features.
- **Write Clean Code:** Follow best practices for writing clean and readable code, such as using meaningful variable names, writing functions for repetitive tasks, and adding comments where necessary.
- **Test Thoroughly:** Test your programs with different inputs to ensure they handle edge cases and errors gracefully.
- **Seek Feedback:** If possible, have someone else review your code or compare your solutions with others to learn different approaches.
- **Build Upon Exercises:** Many of these exercises can be expanded into larger projects. Feel free to add features or combine exercises for a more comprehensive application.
